<br>

<br>
I had learnt HTML4 back in middle school and when I tried to learn external CSS after half a decade, it turns out that HTML5 is really good and laden with all new rules from W3C. 
<br>
With his reposiory, I aim at storing my HTML documents and especially the various CSS methods I learn with it. I aim at completing flexbox, grid-type and finally bootstrap by the end of  August 2019 (Extended to the end of Dec 2019) .
<br>
ICRYM was one of the projects i had decided upon making. The front end felt me happy. So, i felt i should share it here.

**Most of my learning and ideas come from a wonderful website**- <https://codepen.io>

## Extension 
Well, seems I wasn't inspired after the edX course. So, this I have started anew. Coursera has this wonderful specialisation on web development taught by  Prof Colleen.
And I guess it should be done by the time this month gets over.
