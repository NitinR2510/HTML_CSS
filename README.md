I had learnt HTML4 back in middle school and when I tried to learn external CSS after half a decade, it turns out that HTML5 is really good and laden with all new rules from W3C. 
<br>
With his reposiory, I aim at storing my HTML documents and especially the various CSS methods I learn with it. I aim at completing flexbox, grid-type and finally bootstrap by the end of  August 2019 (Extended to the end of Dec 2019) .
